# 深度學習應用於電腦視覺專案說明
In this project, I organize a process by using image segmentation model to reconstruct industrial equipment in a virtual environment, this innovative approach allows us to create virtual repre-sentations of equipment with textures derived from the real world. While the technology is still progressing towards real-time mapping, it presents a promising solution for accurate texture re-construction. The significance of this project extends beyond not only visual fidelity, but also offers substantial benefits in terms of environmental sustainability[1], operational efficiency[2], and logistical simplicity.
Keywords: Texture Mapping, Real-Time Rendering, Salient Object Detection, 3D Visualization, Virtual Reality.


# Project Source

- [ ]  Code Scripts

  - Main： [`main.ipynb`](https://github.com/WuRobber/CVMaterial/blob/main/DLCV/main.ipynb)

  - Camera Calibration： [`main.ipynb`](https://github.com/WuRobber/CVMaterial/blob/main/DLCV/cameracalibration.ipynb)
  
  - Main code is used for real-time video stream processing, and the camera calibration code is used for camera calibration. And the [CameraCalibration_srcdata](https://github.com/WuRobber/CVMaterial/blob/main/DLCV/CameraCalibration_srcdata) folder shows the source images and the camera calibration result.
